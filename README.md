# Make Change Project

## Description
This is my very first Java project while at Skill Distillery Boot Camp.
After hitting run on the application, you will be prompted if you would like to make a transaction. Respond yes or no accordingly. If no, the application will end. If yes, you will be asked for the price of the item you are buying. You may enter this in as an int or as a double. Then you will prompted to enter the amount of money given to pay for the item. From here the
application will tell you if you have given exact change, if you are short on the balance, or give you the exact change for the transaction. Change will be read out for each type of currency that will be given and how many of each bill or coin.

## What I learned
This project helped me build my foundational knowledge of Java. I was able to put into practice using different methods along with taking in arguments and returning information from said method. I used loops, scanners, conditional logic, along with the basic syntax to build my first Java application at Skill Distillery.

### Technologies Used
Java, Eclipse, Git, Atom
